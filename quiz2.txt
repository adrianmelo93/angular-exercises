Instructions: create a new repository called ng-ds-test. Within this repo, create a README.md file. Copy and paste all of these questions into this README file and answer them.

1-Name and describe the two main operations of a stack (to add and remove data).
push   <<-->>  The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array
pop   <<--->>  The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array

2-Name and describe the two main operations of a queue (to add and remove data).
enqueue   <<-->> add element
dequeue   <<-->>remove element


3-Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27
                                         30
                              ------ 15      ------45
                         ------10 - --- 20    ---40----50
                                        --27


4-Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
    --Is balanced


5-Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
                                               30
                                      ---15   --40---45
                                    --10---27
                                      ---20--29

6-Consider the following tree:
------5
---2-----8
-1--3

Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance?
                          ------5
                         ----2-------8
                         --1---3
                        -0
the first node to go out of balance is 5

7-How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
                                   -----2
                              ------ 1-----3
                                0---        ---5
                                      -----------8

8-What are the four main steps of mergesort?
1-split array in 2
2-mergesort  left half
3-mergesort right half
4-Join the two arrays

9-Say you have a program which handles the login queue to a game server. The game server is able to log in one person every one second. Assume that one second must elapse after a person logs in with an empty queue before they are removed from the queue. Draw the state of the queue at 12:00:06, considering the following sequence of events:

At 12:00:00 Hades logs in
At 12:00:00 Ares logs in
At 12:00:00 Zeus logs in
At 12:00:00 Buzz Light Year logs in
At 12:00:02 Kanye West logs in
At 12:00:03 Taylor Swift logs in
At 12:00:03 Darkwing Duck logs in   <<<<<----------------
At 12:00:04 Evil Mickey logs in.     <<<<--------
What is an angular directive?


10-What is an angular directive?
-Is extension the html

11-When specifying an angular directive, you write a function which must return an object called:
a. Directive Constructor
b. Fidel y Chavez Object
c. Directive Definition object
d. Directive Object                  <<<-----

12-What is the relationship between html, the $scope construct, and angular expressions? (Expressions are the ones that are written like so: {{quote}} ).
 >>> Use angular expession

13-In order to send ajax requests in Angular, the most accepted programming convention is to create an angular:
a. Module
b. Service
c. Controller
d. $http            <<<--------

14-In order to create a service, you must use the following angular function:
a. angularApp.controller
b. angularApp.module
c. angularApp.directive
d. angularApp.factory       <<<<---------

15-Do this exercise: https://github.com/Real-Skill/angular-exercises/tree/exercise1 You will need to run git checkout exercise1 in addition to the commands listed in that readme. You do not need to run grunt karma.
